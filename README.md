# Rustgen

Inspired by [Hygen](https://www.hygen.io/) is this a code generator written in Rust!
While its pretty different from Hygen itself, it tries to archive the same goal: generating code.

It follows the same principle of writing generators (templates), filling them out and placing them, where they belong.
And as well as creating new files it also generates code into existing files.

This application is not bound to any language, so it's not just for Rust but written in Rust.

## Why?

Because I wanted to do something in Rust... and I don't like the idea of having JavaScript (Node.JS) installed just for generating code. Rust can do this aswell but without a bigger runtime around it.
